The main content of this project code involves machine learning methods for predicting obesity. The code and analysis are based on a dataset containing health indicators. The following are the key parts of the code and an overview of the task:

1. **Task Objective**:

* Use health measurement data (such as gender, age, dietary habits, and physical condition) to predict obesity levels.

* The dataset provides two obesity indicators: one directly calculated using BMI (weight/heightÂ²) and the other categorical (such as normal weight, overweight, and obesity levels).

2. **Data Description**:

* This dataset contains multiple obesity-related features, including gender, age, dietary habits, and physical activity.

* Features include frequent consumption of high-calorie foods, frequency of vegetable consumption, daily water consumption, and frequency of physical activity.

3. **Data Processing**:

* The code first imports the necessary libraries (such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).

* The data is loaded and previewed, using `pandas` to read a CSV file and display the first few rows of the data.

4. **Analysis and Visualization**:

* Data visualization will help interpret charts and trends to reveal obesity-related patterns.
* During the data analysis phase, various statistical models and machine learning methods were used, such as linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and support vector machines.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:

* The `train_test_split` function was used to partition the dataset, normalize feature data, and evaluate model performance through cross-validation, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

In summary, this project explored how to predict obesity using health data through various data analysis and machine learning techniques, and provided relevant recommendations and model evaluation methods.
